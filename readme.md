# First Mate

To use this tool, you have multiple options based on your operating system. For Mac or Windows, you can run the pre-built executables available in the releases tab. Alternatively, you can directly run the application using Python. If you're using a Mac, you might need to navigate to the Privacy & Security settings to manually grant permission for the app to run.

You can also run the `build.py` script yourself to generate your own executable.
